For the last 6 years I was using RxJava starting from pre 1.0 version, but today I'm going to try and use courutines so don't judge harshly as I'm new here

Structured concurrency is really awesome


I would write my own repository, alpha version is not good, but still interesting to see what they got


If you have any questions regarding implementation, please rise the issue here. I want to make this sample long-lasting and maintainable.


Didn't do DI wiring for quite awhile, it didn't get better

//todo scoping is done by the viewmodel lib


# todo 2 pics with and without DI
